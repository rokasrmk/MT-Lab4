This lab aims to build your first WebRTC app.

There are many open source alternatives to build a simple communication application like Skype. One of the web based solution is WebRTC. You can try a huge set of examples: 
https://webrtc.github.io/samples/

# Requirements for repository
  - You have to clone this repository and make two branches (master and develop).
  - The develop branch should contain commits of every new feature of the AR application.
  - When all features will be ready you have to merge the development branch to the master.

# Requirements for WebRTC application
There are three options to choose from. 

Option A:
  - Use WebRTC filter application code (https://github.com/webrtc/samples/tree/gh-pages/src/content/getusermedia/filter) and additional filter like Canny Edge filter or any other non existing in the sample.
  - It is also needed to add a slider to control a threshold/gain for your filter. It should work realtime.  

Option B:
  - Use WebRTC filter application code (https://github.com/webrtc/samples/tree/gh-pages/src/content/getusermedia/filter) and add face detector. Tracking.js is good place to start (https://trackingjs.com/examples/face_camera.html).

Option C:
  - It is your chance to show your skills and creativity.
  - You can add extra features to existing WebRTC examples.
  - Or anything other.
  
The general requirements for option A, B & C:
  - Test application on at least two browsers and specify in README.md which version and browser it was.
  - To pass this lab, you have to fully complete an option.
